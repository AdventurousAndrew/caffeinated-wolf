# The Worksheet Generator

## Specification
Using this generator, users can make worksheets with questions of various difficulties on various topics in the IB curriculum.
A popup window appears and allows them to select the level of difficulty that they want.

After the questions are selected, the corresponding question images will appear on the user's screen.
When the user is finished with the question set, the answer images for the same questions will appear on the user's screen.
Then they compare their work with the markscheme, they could press the corresponding buttons on the popup window to indicate if they got the question correct, partially correct or totally off. Points will be rewarded based on the accuracy and the difficulty of the questions.


__Questions__ (png)

The name of each question follows the convention "[topic][subtopic][level][variant]".

For example, question "A0112" means the question is on topic A, subtopic 01, level 1, variant 2.

The list of topics and subtopics can be found on the spreadsheet (to be sent).


__Answers__ (png)

The name of each solution follows the convention "[topic][subtopic][level][variant]A"

For example, answers "A0112A" is the answer for question A0112 above.


## Future directions

+ The maximum score they could earn is consistent with the question set they've chosen. For example, if they chose an easy set, an error message should follow that they did not click this correctly.

+ The score from each question is recorded (incorrect, partially correct, fully correct) on both the user's end and our end.

+ Create an automated grading system (think Webwork) that allows equivalent answers.

+ Of course this model could be extended to different subjects.
